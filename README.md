In this project, I will be using the dataset called "WEATHER PREDICTION" that I found on Kaggle. There will be 2 parts in this article, the first is pre-processing and analyzing the weather data and the second part is building a prediction model with a decision tree and random forest.

There are different stages called -
Data Pre-processing
Analysis
Model Training (Decision Tree and Random Forest)
Model Evaluation
Comparasion
